# HANGOUT

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started



If you receive a cocoapods error just run these...


```bash
sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin cocoapods -v 1.8.4
```


if that does not work then you uninstall it then you run 

```bash
brew install cocoapods
```

And

```bash
brew link --overwrite cocoapods
```
